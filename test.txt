Hello world learning github changes
xyq_vs_code_branch added, the code difference would be that in main there would be no commit of the xyq branch.


Added one line -> The new line added will show in green shadow. The green shadow reflects the changes added.

Will create new branch called github learning and will try to add it using via github.

What does stage really means?               |
--------------------------------------------|
Stage = Present to judges.                  |

Commit = Judges officially taste & score it.

Push = Your dish gets broadcast to the whole competition.

🔑 Key Idea

Yes, you can stage multiple times before a single commit.
Git lets you add to the staging area in batches until you’re satisfied with what should go into that commit.

No, you don’t need to commit every tiny change.
If you commit every character or whitespace change, your history becomes messy and hard to follow.

⚖️ Best Practice Balance

Small but meaningful commits
----------------------------

Each commit should represent one logical unit of work.
------------------------------------------------------

Example: “Fix login bug” or “Add profile picture upload feature.”

Stage until the commit makes sense
----------------------------------

You can git add multiple times to gradually build the right set of changes.

Once you’re confident — commit.

Avoid two extremes

❌ Too small: Committing after every single keystroke → noisy history.

❌ Too big: One giant commit with 500 changes → impossible to review or roll back.

✅ Just right: Each commit is atomic, self-contained, and meaningful.

📌 Think of it like writing a book:

Drafting sentences (working directory) = your live changes.

Highlighting the right paragraphs (staging) = choosing what fits this chapter.

Publishing the chapter (commit) = permanent snapshot.

You wouldn’t publish after every comma, but also not after writing the entire book in one go.
